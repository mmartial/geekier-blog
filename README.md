# A Geekier Blog

A place to put different writeups I did, and use this page as an indexer for it.
Much of the content is written in other locations already, and I am consolidating/extending them into a common location with tags.
As much as those posts are not intended as opinion pieces, their content is opinionated as I propose solutions based on the technologies I use.

There is much to be done with formatting for indexing and the use of tags, so please be patient as the repository evolves. 
And please, feel free to help me fix/evolve the content and/or add UI features.

Those are tutorials written using the technologies for different purposes.
When using one, I recommend obtaining the Markdown source file to make copy/paste but also modifications easy.
For example, modify the path to a location, find and replace it in the entire downloaded document and your copy/pasting exercise will be simplified greatly.

From a practical standpoint, having those ready is useful for me when setting up a new system.
I am not going to make videos or add referral links in posts, this is not what those are about.

A `Revision` at the top of each post informs the reader when content is changed. 
Its naming convention is `YYYYMMDD-Rev` with `Rev` a number increasing from 0.
For example, `20240229-0` is the initial release for 2024-02-29.
Details pertinent to those changes will be documented at the end of the document in a "Revision History" section.
I likely will not increase numbers when adjusting sentences, formatting or grammatical content.

The content is provided on an "as is" basis, and no warranty, either express or implied, is given. Your use of the service is at your sole risk.

Hopefully, those prove useful to you, as they are for me.
