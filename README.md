# A Geekier Blog

A place to put different writeups I did, and use this page as an indexer for it.
Much of the content is written in other locations already, and I am consolidating them into a common location with tags.
Hopefully, those prove useful to you, as they were for me.

Those are tutorials written using the technologies for different purposes.
When using one, I recommend obtaining the Markdown source file to make copy/paste but also modifications easy.
For example, modify the path to a location, find and replace it in the entire downloaded document and your copy/pasting exercise will be simplified greatly.

I intend to use a `Revision` at the top of the document to let you know what changed, the naming convention is `YYYYMMDD-Rev` with `Rev` a number increasing from 0.
For example, `20240229-`0` is the initial release for 2024-02-29.
I likely will not increase numbers when adjusting sentences, formatting or grammatical content.

There is much to be done with formatting for indexing and use of tags, so bear with me as the repository grows and evolves.
